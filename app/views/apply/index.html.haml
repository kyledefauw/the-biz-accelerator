  %h2 Application

%p The application is designed to be a complete Self Discovery process for each applicant that will have value even if the applicant is not accepted for the position they are applying for.

%p Many share the results with family and friends and Founder/Co-Creators share the results with their fellow Founder/Co-Creators to enable the team to be more effective. Coach/mentors also complete the application and share that with their Founder/Co-Creators and other coach/mentors.

%p We believe this set of discovery tools can have huge value for those who take the time to complete them. Your feedback is always appreciated, so please give us some we can share with others as well as what you would prefer to remain confidential.

%p Each potential Co-Creator fills out the “Application and Mini-workshop” and submits:
