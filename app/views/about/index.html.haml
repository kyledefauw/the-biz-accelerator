  %h2 About Us

%p Thomas Gerber and Herb Tabak incorporated Business Co-Creation Strategies as a Colorado C-Corp in 2008 when they were both in their late 60ies.

%p Both had started a number of their own businesses and wanted to support businesses that “Were good for Humanity and the Planet” and could scale to a size that was at least national, if not inter-national.

%p They both felt that any business that was “Good for Humanity and the Planet” has the obligation to grow as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality.

%p Since 2008 they began a number of their own businesses and did some consulting with businesses that could truly make a difference.

%p This latest “re-invention” of their desire to “make as much of a positive difference as possible” is an exciting combination of a number of entities that enables them to have even more impact. In effect, they get to “Joint-Venture” with Visionaries and support entrepreneurial interns at the same time as starting businesses that are “Good for Humanity and the Planet”. Everyone wins – Humanity, The Planet, BCCS, Visionaries, Under Employed Interns and Seniors, The Economy.
